Using the SQLBook database and lessons learnt from Data Analysis Using SQL and Excel, 2nd Edition by Mr. Gordon S. Linoff, created the following parameterized functions:

1. Create a parametrized function to obtain the top 10 customers by amount ordered within a specific time period and state
2. Create a function to find the top 5 cities based on order amount in a particular state and within a specific time period
3. Find the top 25 customers of all time based on amount ordered within a particular state and payment method - VI, MC, AE, DB
4. Create function to obtain top 10 cities based on average order amount per state and campaign id - also list number of orders
5. Create a function to find ZIPNames in a state where percentage of people in the age group of 25 - 34 is more than a certain amount
6. Create a function to obtain top 10 customers based on total orders within a specified time period, specific state and campaign id
7. Create function to get product ID within a certain group code that are in and out of stock
8. Create a function to see the products that have difference in order date and ship date within certain time period
9. Create a function to see what the top 25 most ordered product is in a particular state during a particular time period
10. Create a function to find the top 25 tenure subscribers based on their rate plan, market and channel
